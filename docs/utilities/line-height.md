Apply `line-height` values with utility classes. Values can optionally be applied only at specific [breakpoints]({{ site.baseurl }}/utilities/breakpoint).

Using the Sass mixin is preferred, as it forces us to consider all objects as [components]({{ site.baseurl }}/guidance/components). Applying utility classes in HTML enforces `!important`, as they're intended to be immutable â€” applying one property and value no matter what.

### Values
* `default`
* `xx-tight`
* `x-tight`
* `tight`
* `loose`
* `x-loose`
* `xx-loose`
* `1` to `11` (only available in mixin)

## Breakpoints

`line-height` values can selectively only be applied when certain [breakpoints]({{ site.baseurl }}/utilities/breakpoint) are triggered.
