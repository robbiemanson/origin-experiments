Use `font-size` to apply values using our mixin or utility classes. Values can optionally be applied only at specific [breakpoints]({{ site.baseurl }}/utilities/breakpoint).

Using the Sass mixin is preferred, as it forces us to consider all objects as [components]({{ site.baseurl }}/guidance/components). Applying utility classes in HTML enforces `!important`, as they're intended to be immutable â€” applying one property and value no matter what.

### Values
* `default`
* `xx-small`
* `x-small`
* `small`
* `large`
* `x-large`
* `xx-large`
* `1` to `17` (only available in mixin)
